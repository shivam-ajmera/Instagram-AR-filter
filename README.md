# Instagram-AR-filter

## Inspiration
During this quarantine, we got sick and tired of scrolling through social media and overused filters that didn't highlight what's happening in the real world around us. We decided to use the power of social media to encourage others to stay at home and safe during this pandemic.

## What it does
It's an interactive augmented reality filter that can be used on some of the most popular social media platforms. It involves a viral meme with a strong message to remind the community to stay strong and that we're all in this together.

## How we built it
We mainly used the Spark AR studio and Photoshop/ Video editing tools to build this augmented reality-based filter.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using Spark AR studio and working on a 3 Dimensional interface. We slowly understood the power of Augmented Reality and its simple but practical applications in today's world.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to complete this project that could successfully (and hopefully) be launched, within simply 24 hours.

## What we learned
- AR and its applications.
- Photoshop
- Video Editing
- 3D space visualization

## What's next for "Who's Coffin?"
We hope to improve our AR filter and build more advanced AR concepts that could help in our day to day activities.
